# Beyblade Detection & Tracking System

Welcome to the Beyblade Detection & Tracking repository! This project leverages advanced Computer Vision techniques to detect, track, and analyze Beyblade spinning tops, including collision detection.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a system that detects spinning Beyblades, classifies their states (spinning vs. still), and tracks their movement. The system also includes a collision detection module using machine learning and Kalman Filter-based methodologies.

### Key Features
- **Detection**: Utilizes transfer learning with YOLOv8 for accurate bounding box predictions.
- **Classification**: Differentiates between spinning and still Beyblades with high precision.
- **Tracking**: Implements Kalman Filters for stable object tracking.
- **Collision Detection**: Identifies collisions using Intersection over Union (IoU) and predictive models.
- **Data Visualization**: Outputs predictions as bounding boxes with added effects like life bars and wake animations.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Videos collected using an iPhone 12 (60 fps) across multiple angles:
  - **0°**: Side view
  - **45°**: Tilted view
  - **90°**: Top-down view
- Dataset created with diverse backgrounds and Beyblade types to ensure robustness.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Frames extracted from videos.
- Bounding boxes annotated in YOLO format: `[x_center, y_center, width, height]`.

### 3. Training
- Transfer learning with a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- Initial layers frozen to retain backbone features.
- Model outputs refined with evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices.

### 4. Prediction & Tracking
- Real-time inference generates bounding boxes for new inputs.
- Kalman Filters predict and correct object positions across frames.
- Average color matching ensures consistent tracking.

### 5. Collision Detection
- IoU-based approach identifies grazes between objects.
- Dynamic thresholds adapt to bounding box size for accuracy.
- Frame cooldown prevents repeated collision counts.

## Results
- **Detection**: High accuracy in spinning vs. still classification.
- **Tracking**: Stable tracking of spinning tops, even during rapid movement.
- **Collision Detection**: Robust performance with all test cases.

## Future Developments
- Integration with Raspberry Pi for standalone operation.
- Virtual reality support for enhanced visualization.
- Dataset optimization for improved model performance.
- Advanced features like trajectory prediction and real-time analytics.
